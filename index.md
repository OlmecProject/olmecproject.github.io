# Olmec

Olmec is a proof-of-concept in end-to-end token-gating.

## End-to-end token-gating

[End-to-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle) token-gated content is the next big step in web3.

Most content in web2 is gated, from Netflix and YouTube to Amazon's ebooks and Instagram. As a creator, *you* are uploading *your* content to the server owned by a company. As a consumer, *you* are only buying temporary access to view the content or are paying by spending your time to watch ads.

That will all change in web3. As a creator, *you* can own your own content and distribute them directly to your consumers. As a consumer, *you* can buy directly from creators. You can also resell into a market, lend to friends, or collect them.

Remember when you could lend out a book to friends? You can't do that with ebooks on Amazon. Or resell a vinyl records to a store? You can't do that with a Spotify subscription. That's all coming back digitally.

NFTs are the way we get from here to there. But now, NFTs display metadata for all to see. With private NFTs, an NFT can unlock content if you own it. That's the beauty of end-to-end token-gating.

## App

We built an app as a proof-of-concept for end-to-end token-gating.

It uses the [Secret](http://scrt.network) blockchain to handle the private tokens and [ipfs](https://ipfs.tech) to store encrypted files. The app lets you encrypt and upload your content to ipfs and hides the password to the content in the Secret token. You can send your tokens to your friends, who can only unencrypt the file if they own the token.

A unique feature of this tech stack is that you don't need our app to use the stack. You can use third-party software or command line tools to do the same things you would do on the app.
